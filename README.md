# Employee Tracker



## Description
In this application you have the ability to manage a company and its employees using a CLI interface. The application will be run using node index and the application will greet the user with a list of questions. The program will run in a loop until the user decides to exit. In this application I used MySQL to create databases and store persistent data along with using the inquirer npm package to prompt the user questions. The console table package was used to display table data, and finally the figlet package was used to create the EMPLOYEE TRACKER ascii art.
